The product we have created is GO VIRAL, which is an API that uses data from Youtube, including the number of views, the number of likes and dislikes, how long the video has been up for, the number of comments, and the favorite count. These are used to determine the view count that the video will have. We have created a website, goviral.ml, which includes an about us page. We plan to sell this product to Youtube, and start out by selling it for low prices to users who want to predict the amount of views that they will get, which will allow them to determine the amount of money they will make based on the video.
